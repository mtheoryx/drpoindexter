- AWS Root mfa, use hardware, not virtual. Here's why!
- AWS Billing alerts, and budgets, and a potential real-world example
- AWS accounts and types of users (root, human, agent)
- AWS Stopped EC2 costs, easy to miss, vampire of cost (unattached ENI, and ebs volumes)
- AWS delete your default vpcs! (You can get them back) Here's why
- Terraform ssh keygen temporary EC2 test instances, and an alternative (ssm agent, no keys)
- Dangers of Docker Latest tag (need to get definitive answers)
- Docker utility containers (maybe co-op with Lannon) (AWS Xray is one example)
- Docker compose bootstrapping containers (Test-runs, config stuff, misc one-time things)
- Docker volumes, npm node_modules, and what is an unnamed annonymous volume?
- Why is it called AWS EC2, but called Amazon Chime?
- What does "getting certified" look like? And why do it? (process, sharing on linked in, contract/employment, cert benefits)
