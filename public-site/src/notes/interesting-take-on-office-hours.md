This is a professor in the UK that streams Sea of Thieves for office hours. So instead of a formal setting, which students may be afraid of, and for those who are reluctant to ask questions during the class time, they can pop in and watch a game stream and just ask questions on topics they're covering right in the chat.

I've never heard of anything like this, but this seems like such a clever solution to many problems.
