title: "What Cert should I get?"

## What are they and why do they matter

AWS, like most other vendor of... well, anything, has a certification program. These are used to validate basic competancy in a few areas. It can be related to services, application experience, domain knowledge, or a mis of all three. Obtaining a certification will be an act in 3 parts:

1. Study, and know the stuff
1. Scheule a test (and pay for a test, depending on the certification level)
1. Pass the test and share that news everywhere you can, congrats!

So lets dive into the types of vendor-certified...

### Accreditations (no cost, not proctored exam, don't expire)

These are tests that anyone can take. No prerequeites required. There is not proctor exam fee. And if you fail you can re-test as many times as you require to pass. Because of this, although they do contain validation of important topics, are no regarded as a signifier at particularly special credentials, nor recognized at events.

For exmaple, you will not get into the "certified lounge" at re:invent or other regional conferences with just these credentials. Ask me for a funny storry about that one ;)

So here are the accredidation courses:

- AWS Technical Professional
- AWS Cloud Economics
- AWS STP: Foundations (technical)
- AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials

### Certifications (pay to testing center, proctored exam, expire in 3 years, require full-test renewal)

Key points:

- You pay to take these
- The credentials don't last forever, 3 years is the current validation time frame
- You will need to recertify to keep "current"
- The "current" status is verifialble in public, via a unique id

## Recommended order (from my perspective)

1. All 3 accredidations for every person in your company that will work in or develop in the cloud. Table stakes.
1. Cloud practitioner for sales and technicians.
1. One of the Associates, as a starting point.
1. The other two associates, before you go for professional at all.
1. A speciality, based on need or job role.
1. A pro in your field.

And then get the rest, like pokemon. Hecc, it can't hurt.
