### <a name="what-is-twitch"></a>What is Twitch

Twitch is a bunch of things, offered nowhere else:

Promotion tool
Social Network
Hacker Space
Crowd-Programming
Research platform
Artistic Expression
Conference Platform

Think of Twitch as a meetup, at first. Remember meetups?

So you have someone with content, or a few people. You have a space. You have people attend. On the side you have people who are hiring, people want to be hired, vendors wanting to sell, and companies wanting to buy.

It's a whole ecosystem that suddenly became nigh but irrelevant in 2020. Good news: We've been doing this Twitch thing since before 2019, so certainly before COVID-19.

### <a name="teams-and-individuals"></a>Teams and Individuals

Individuals streaming on their own channels are a fantastic way to start entering this sphere.

What starts out as an ambitious individual striking into the world of streaming can quickly become a powerhouse for your brand. The platform could be used for showcasing wins, talking about challenges, running contests, doing demos, anything you can image.

To not: Typically individuals are streaming as themselves. They are not beholden to only talk about "company stuff" and it's important to both realize that, and embrace it.

People come to the stream for the person, the community, and the content. Not to learn about your company like it's some kind of zoom webinar. New world thinking is required.

If a team has several individuals streaming on their own, it can be helpful to collaborate together on a team channel. The way this looks is that the team channel ends up being a hub that hosts those individuals, and/or special events and guests.

Twilio and Microsoft (enumerated below) are great examples of this. However, they are only there because of the time/expense investment. Baby steps.

## <a name="first-steps"></a>First Steps

Figure out who. Content. Promote. Test streams. Video editing. Equipment, workflows. Scenes, transitions. Schedule/time box.
