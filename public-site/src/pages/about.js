        I'm a Cloud Architect at a consulting company based in the Mid-West U.S.
        I'm excited about the future of technology, humble and always eager to
        learn and teach, and look every challenge in the face and know "Well
        I've always figured it out before, why would this time be any
        different?"

      <h2>The boring stuff</h2>
      <h3>A Career Change, Hard Work, and a Bit of Luck</h3>

      <p>
        After quite a large career change, I returned to university, and
        immediately pursued a Student Hourly position at my school. I was
        working mostly in the media production space and developing distributed
        education technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I transitioned to custom application development, and was offered a
        Proffessional Staff position at Indiana University. I've since embraced
        several unique types of challenges in private sector including
        financial, education, and medical industries.
      </p>

      <h3>Currently Working: In Consulting</h3>

        Learning particular frustrations, goals, and limitations of a particular
        client's problem space, then having the freedom to recommend solutions
        can be extremely rewarding when you do ship the solution, and see the
        client's delight at the results.
