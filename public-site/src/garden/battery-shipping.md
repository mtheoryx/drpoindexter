title: "Lithium Ion Battery shipping heads up"
---

I purchased some LIPO batteries from Adafruit for a few projects. For the shipping, I thought it was interesting that I couldn't use USPS, only UPS.

I wonder where this comes from? I'm pretty sure I've shipped in an iPhone for an exchange program via USPS and that definitely has a lithium ion battery.
