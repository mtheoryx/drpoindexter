title: "Should my obs audio be in green, yellow, or red?"
---

Speech should be firmly in the yellow zone on the meter, sometimes touching the red zone.

Nothing should live fully in the red, that is audio clipping and a bad time for everyone.

Other stuff like background music, game sounds/music, ambient noise should live somewhere in the green (if you even intend to have it at all) and shouldn't even peak into the yellow, let alone the red.
