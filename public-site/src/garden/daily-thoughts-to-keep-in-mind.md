## On Pleasing People

"You can please some of the people, some of the time." - Steve Jobs.

## On Empathy

- Extend grace, by default.
- Assume positive intent.

You don't know what you don't know. And what you don't know can be some really tough stuff someone else is dealing with.

## Everyone has a bad day

Related to the above, don't "give a pass" to obvious transgressions, but people make mistakes. Give space for learning, growth, apology, and reflection.

## You are not your social media

Exit social media when you want. You don't owe a "heads up". You can disconnect whenever you want. You can disengage at any time. And you don't owe anyone an explanation.

Your presense in social media should not be expected unless you're being paid to be there.
